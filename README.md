# vaccine-stock-tracker
An implementation of vaccine stock tracker.

This project consists of 3 parts: the mobile application, the backend server, and the frontend dashboard.

The goal of this project is to collect mass data through the mobile app,
process the data at the backend,
and display the processed data at a web dashboard.

The data collection runs on ODK-X framework
https://odk-x.org/software/

The backend processes data in Java & fowards it to the frontend with Sprint boot.
Endpoints are setup with our own RESTful API.

The frontend displays the data in graphs/charts/maps and provides exportation of those data.

Helpful information & how to use is documented in the .pdf file.
