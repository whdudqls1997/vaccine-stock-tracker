This repository contains the ODK-X Application Designer software.

Complete Android apps, including data entry, synchronization, and distribution,
can be written using HTML and JavaScript files. ODK-X Tables and ODK-X Survey will
serve these files as the skin of your app.

Projects intending to write a Tables app can clone this repository and use it
as a starting point.

Much of the boilerplate of app creation can be avoided by employing the Grunt
tasks specified in the Gruntfile.

For a more complete description of how to use this repository, please see our
user documentation at:
