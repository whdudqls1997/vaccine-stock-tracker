# vaccine-stock-tracker
This project consists of 3 parts: 
the mobile application, 
the backend server, 
and the frontend dashboard.

The goal of this project is to: 
collect mass data through the mobile app,
process the data at the backend,
and display the processed data at a web dashboard.

The mobile app and datastream runs on ODK-X framework. (https://odk-x.org/software/)

The backend processes data in Java and fowards it to the frontend with Sprint boot.
Endpoints are setup with our own RESTful API.

The frontend displays the data in graphs/charts/maps and provides exportation of those data.

The project is documented in the .pdf file.
